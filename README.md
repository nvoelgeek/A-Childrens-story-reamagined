# A Childrens story reamagined

# Introduction 

I have chosen to adapt a children's story.  The author is Toon Telligan, a Dutch writer who was most popular in the 1960s.  The story I am adapting is Squirrel's birthday.  It is one of my daughter's favorite stories. All of the characters use him/his/he pronouns.

Toon Telligan has four children's books that are made of collections of short stories. The stories are whimsical and usually feature a squirrel and an elephant.  The stories often have philosophical lessons and all the characters in the stories use him/his/he pronouns.  In five-year-old speak " They are ALL boys! That's not fair!" The majority of children's books feature a male protagonist.  Usually if there are more than three or four characters one of the lesser characters is female, however, that isn't the case in this series. Therefore I've chosen to remaster it with equal representation of hers and his.

# Historical Context  

This story was written in 1995.  By Toon Telligan a General Practitioner of Medicine in Amsterdam.  Gender representation in novels at the time and currently tends to be male-dominated.  Typically men are in positions of power in publishing houses and publish men's novels, articles, journals and books with much more frequency than women.  Typically with the argument that women are weak writers. Women are more successful in getting children's, homemaking and romance novels published, as these are often considered women's work. This is impacted by editors and publishers. Therefore the representation available in children's book has suffered.  The majority of the characters are his/he/him pronouns, even when the characters are animals as in this work that I've chosen. 

# The Adaptation 

I've chosen to adapt one of Toon Telligans more popular works.  The squirrel's birthday, from the above series.  I choose this work because its one of my daughter's favorites stories and it is a fun story to read aloud.  It's silly and unexpected..so often children's books avoid "bad" behavior.  As though mentioning it encourages it.  The squirrels birthday is unique in that bad behavior is at the center of the story. It is different from Toon Telligans other works in that there is a large cast of characters.  Toon Telligans stories often feature 2 or 3 characters. 

### Formal Qualities 



### Cultural Meaning 

As we acknowledge as a society the role that gender plays in determining economic, social and cultural significance within our society we began to move toward a more representational society.  Half of the people in the world give or take a few hundred thousand are women. Yet over 80% of novels, books, journals, and articles are published by men.  In order to effect immediate change children's literature endeavors to be equally representative.  As we see more articles, novels, and books being published by women we should also look back and ask.  What if some of our favorite stories were adapted with a goal of gender inclusion? There are stories we remember from our childhoods that form our identities.  What if our identities were formed with women and girls in mind? Who would we be? Who would our women and girls be? 

# Rhetorical Significance  
I argue that women and girls would be more complete versions of themselves.  Representation allows a role to be imagined. You see yourself there and you are participating and acknowledged.  As we build our identities we imagine who we will become and a large part of that imagining is through mirroring.  Mirroring what you see and hear others do. 



# Reflection 

I intend to work on furthering this project into a journal article.  I will take this adaptation as an example of how much impact can be made with so little change. How the integrity of the work remains while including women and girls as participants in society through this story.
